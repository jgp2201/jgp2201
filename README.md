# 💫 About Me:
---

👋 Hi, I'm Jayvardhan Patel!. I’m a Computer Engineering student at **DEPSTAR** with a passion for software development. I am currently learning **Java development** and improving my backend and problem-solving skills through hands-on projects. I have worked on **Materoom**, a smart roomate and room finder web app based on user's compatibility, and **ChatUp**, a secure real-time chat application focusing on privacy and smooth communication along with chatbot, custom wallpapers and Text translation.

I enjoy experimenting with new tools, writing better code every day, and continuously learning by doing.

I'm actively involved in coding challenges and continuously seek to grow my skills. Check out my projects here on GitHub or connect with me to collaborate!
